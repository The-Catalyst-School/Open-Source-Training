# Lesson 1 

**Overview:** A first lesson to help learners get their bearings around Cardano, Project Catalyst
and Catalyst School community

**Learning objectives:**

1. Know Markdown is and how to write basic markdown. 
1. Know where to find resources that help navigate the Cardano communities and demystify jargon.
1. Know why we use GitHub, have a GitHub account and know a few GitHub terms.

## Introduction 

The open source community is full of different kinds of people, tools, and working practices. This can be very confusing when you're new as there are as many ways to do things as there are people in the community.
Learning about a new community can be daunting, especially for large communities. This lesson will
help learners who ware new to the Cardano Community begin to learn about how we use open source
tools around the Catalyst project, and how you can become an active creator and contributor using
the same tools.

**Note**: This lesson is meant to be followed along either individually, or in a synchronous community session. To get the most out of this lesson, it is important to create a text document, you could use Markdown (more on that later), to help organize your notes, thoughts and responses to the various challenges. In the process of doing so, you'll be creating a resource that you can refer back to, and you'll be asked to contribute some of your research, notes and perspectives to the communtiy as Open Source contributions. It is our hope, that through this hands-on approach you can build capability and confidence in the work of gathering information, organizing it and sharing it with a broader communtiy of practice. 


## Markdown 

Around the Catalyst Project and Catalyst School Markdown is the way in which we create documentation
and share ideas, reports and progress on our activities. Markdown is a particular way of writing
plain text files that allows it to be translated into formatted/styled text. 

(FIXME example of plain text and rendered text)

### What is Markdown?

Markdown allows us to focus on content alone when writing, and we don't have to worry about styling
or particular details of formatting. Our text can be used/reused and styled in many different ways
if we write it in Markdown in the first place. In fact, this lesson you're reading now was created
in plain text Markdown before we even considered what it would look like on the website. 

(FIXME Image of  a few Markdown elements - bold, italic, heading, bullet points, numbered lists)

Because we're dealing with computers, the syntax for Markdown can sometimes be a bit frustrating. It is important if you have problems or trouble with Markdown text not rendering properly that you look at your text and make sure it is conforming to Markdown patterns. Some common pitfals include indentation, placement of key symbols, and the line spacing between things like headings and bulleted lists.

### Demystifying Markdown

When we think about writing documents there are a few common things we use to format the document.

1. **Bold Text** `**Bold Text**`
2. *Italic Text* `*Italic Text*`
3. Headings 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 `# Heading 1  ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3...`
4. Horizontal lines `----`
5. Bulleted lists `* Item `
6. Numbered lists `1. Item`

For each of these formattings we have a key character or series of characters that trigger that type
of formatting. **Bold**, *Italic*, ~~Strikethrough~~ each use a "wrapping" syntax
where the content you want to apply that format to is "wrapped" with the triggering symbol (`**`
Bold, `*` Italic, `~~` Striketrhough) at the beginning and end of the text to be
styled that way. 

### Writing your first Markdown 

FIXME - Exercise to write markdown and check its formatting. Possibly in GitHub?

#### Using a Plain Text Editor 

Markdown can be written pretty much anywhere you can find a text box, but there are some editors that are better than others. Word processors such as Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Write are **not** great places to write Markdown. This is because these editors are so-called WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editors that mix formatting and content in the same view. Markdown tries to decouple these two things and focus entirely on content. Editors that are good for plain text are: 

1. Notepad or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (windows)
2. TextEdit / [CotEditor](https://coteditor.com/) / [TextWrangler/BBedit](FIXME) (Mac)
3. gedit / kedit (Linux)
4. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Atom](https://atom.io/) (all operating systems)
5. Vi/Emacs (command line environments)

These editors each have various capabilities, but they all dispense with the idea of styled and formatted output and focus on capabilities for wrting plain-text. Much of programming code and programming documentation is written in these editors, and there is a rich plugin and add-on ecosystem availabile for many of the above editors (especially VS Code) which can speed up and streamline many type of plain-text workflows. These are beyond the scope of this lesson, and we will focus on simple plain-text editors.

**Challenge:** Read up on the websites for some of the above editors and select one and try it out.

## Cardano and Open Source

Cardano and The Catalyst Project believe in working openly and transparently to build a
change-making community that can expand the use of the Cardono improve livelihoods around the world.
To do so the community has adopted a myriad of different tools, systems and working practiices. This
lesson is an attempt to introduce you to a few recommended ways of working and to expose you to how
you can contribute and create your own resources around the Catalyst Community. This work is part of the broader [Catalyst School](FIXME) and is meant as a gentle entry into the community. 

Concepts - 
- Open Source
- Cardano
- ADA currency
- Project Catalyst
- Catalyst School
- Community Governance Model/practices
- Jargon busting

### Learn more about:

#### Open Source

Open Source is a term that means many different things, but in essence it is grounded in an ehtos that creative efforts can be distributed, open to contributions and aimed at building tools which can beneficial to many. These createive outputs, often software, are then shared openly and widely under one of several Open Source Licenses (MIT, GNU, BSD, Apache, CC etc.).  While it is often a term used in software, it can be used in any creative effort that does not seek to hide and protect its creative outputs, but share them openly and widely. In the context of Cardano and the Catalyst communtity, they seek to bring the Open Source ethos, tools and working practices to a communtiy which innovates around decentralized finance. This means that the way the community works is open, collaborative, and open to contribution and participation from anyone who contribtues value to a particular scope of work. In this lesson we will explore some basic contribution models for open source and give you experience contributing, in very basic ways to begin with, to open source repositories. Like anything new, it takes a bit of time to get experience and capabilitiy with new tools. Be kind to yourself as you learn, and build-in to your days time to practice and keep growing in your skills.

**Challenge:** Search the web for an open source project that isn't software. Take a few notes in a document, with a URL, the project name and a brief description of what the project does. Save the notes in a document, we'll be using them later. 

#### Cardano 

Cardano is a different kind of cryptocurrency community which puts people at the center of the creative process of creating positive change that is needed in the world. While Cardano does host and maintain a blockchain infrastructure, it also catalyzes and incentivizes groups of people to contribute to create the change they want to see in the world, fueled by proceeds from maintaining the blockchain. Learn more about what makes the Cardano community interestig at ["Discover Cardano"](https://cardano.org/discover-cardano/)

**Challenge:** What are three things that make Cardano different than other cryptocurrencies?

#### ADA

Ada is the native token of Cardano and acts as a value-store and value-exchange mechanism on the Cardanon blockchain. ADA can be held in various [wallets]({{site.glossary}}/wallet). For more information see the Cardano page ["What is ADA"](https://cardano.org/what-is-ada/). 

**Challenge**: What is a "wallet" and how might you use it to "hold" ADA?

#### Project Catalyst 

Project Catalyst is an experiment in creating, maintaining and operating a decentralized funding treasury that catalyzes innovation in the wider Cardano Communitty. More about [Project Catalyst](https://cardanocataly.st/) can be found in the community website. Periodically the Catalyst communtiy selects proposals to fund. In fact this lesson you're learning from was made possible through Project Catalyst funding to help community members learn about and become contributors to open source communtiies. 

**Challenge:** Name two roles in the Catalyst community.

#### Catalyst School

The Catalyst School is an international and multi-lingual project to help the diverse and global communities of Project Catalyst participants and Cardano enthusiasts to learn about and become capable contributros and leaders in the Catalyst and broader Cardano communities. You can learn more about the Catalyst School and learning opportunities at [their website](https://thecatalyst.school/)

**Challenge**: FIXME

#### Community Governance Model/practices

FIXME - Link to best resources on Governance

####  Jargon Glossary 

We use a lot of differnt jargon around the community. [The Catalyst Glossary](FIXME) can help you
learn about the terms that are used throughout the Cardano Community. 

**Challenge:**  Browse the Jargon Glossary, for any term you're confused by, which does not have a definition, create an issue in the Jargon Glossary for that term.
